### Research

In our research to learn about time series analysis and forecasting, we came across with a few sites that helped us to understand time series modeling, as well as how to create a model.

#### [Statistical forecasting:](http://people.duke.edu/~rnau/411home.htm) <br />
Notes on regression and time series analysis: This site provides a deep dive into time series analysis, explaining every aspect in detail. 


#### [Complete guide to create a Time Series Forecast (with Codes in Python):](http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/02/time-series-forecasting-codes-python/) <br />
It has Python code examples which really helped us.
